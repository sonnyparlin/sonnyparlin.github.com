# sendhelp_bot

## Send Help Now bot for Telegram

1. First Create a private or public group or channel, I created a private group called *Emergency*

2. Add *sendhelp_bot* as an admin to your new group or channel

3. Connect your group or channel to sendhelp_bot by typing `/add @sendhelp_bot` from your group or channel

4. Open *sendhelp_bot* in Telegram, click `/finish_setup`.

5. Now the bot is ready to use, click on `Need a Ride` to notifiy your emergency contacts that you need a ride or click
on `In Danger` to notify your emergency contacts that you're in danger. They will receive your request with your current location. Clicking
the map will open a new screen with a larger map and an option for directions, which will open up your maps app.
