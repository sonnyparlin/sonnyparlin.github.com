I have been training since 2007 and I am a black belt under Rob Kahn (lineage: Helio Gracie > Royce Gracie > Rob Kahn > me).

When I started training I was 270lbs (check out my weight loss story here). Jiu Jitsu changed my life. I started training in Connecticut at the age of 34. In 2012 I moved to Florida specifically to train with Rob Kahn at Gracie Tampa. I had met Rob a few years earlier and was blown away by his instruction. Rob is Royce Gracie’s first black belt and has produced multiple UFC fighters and ADCC veterans. Rob’s strategy-based system of Jiu Jitsu is what I teach adult students at Gracie Bradenton.

**The Gracie Tampa family is a trusted name in mixed martial arts training.**
Gracie Bradenton is a member of the Gracie Tampa Schools network, a network that has produced multiple UFC fighters and Abu Dhabi Combat Club Veterans. (ADCC is the Olympics of Jiu Jitsu).
