I have Covid-19. I tested positive on the 3rd. The tell tale sign for me was not tasting my food. Yes, I've been feeling like shit, but no issues breathing, not even coughing and I never had a temperature, not even when they tested me.

Now that I've said that, let me say this. Having this virus hasn't changed my opinion one bit. I still and will always favor liberty over lockdowns and freedom over fear.

Throughout history, every single impingement on our freedoms and rights came under the mendacious guise of doing some sort of greater good for society and it's always we the people who vote these impingements into law.

> "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." -Ben Franklin

We don't have the government to blame, we have ourselves to blame for voting in the very people who have no problem destroying our livelihoods while they go about living THEIR lives as if nothing has changed.

If you're in a state where the governor is instituting lockdowns and shutting down your business and you voted for that governor, then the person you should be pissed at resides squarely in your mirror.
