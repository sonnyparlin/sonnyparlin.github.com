All over America, small businesses that teach the grappling arts are suffering from lock downs and not being able to open because of Covid-19 restrictions. The aim of this fund is to grant these small businesses cash so that they can continue to keep their doors open and hopefully have a gym to come back to when local restrictions are lifted. Once we have some cash in the fund we can begin accepting grant letters and giving cash to small businesses related to the grappling arts. You can help make a difference by donating to the Grapple Arts Disaster Fund.
